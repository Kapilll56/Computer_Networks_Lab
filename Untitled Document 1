Libraries Used:

<iostream>: For basic input and output operations like printing messages to the console.

<sys/socket.h>: Provides functions for socket creation and manipulation (for network communication).

<netinet/in.h>: Defines constants and structures for internet domain addresses (IPv4).

<unistd.h>: Contains system calls like read, write, and close for interacting with file descriptors (like sockets).

<cstring>: For memory manipulation functions like memset and strcmp.

Server Code:

Create a Socket: The server creates a TCP socket using socket().

Bind the Socket: The server binds the socket to an IP address (INADDR_ANY) and a port number (e.g., 5001).

Listen for Connections: It listens for incoming connections using listen().

Accept Connection: When a client connects, the server accepts the connection with accept().

Receive Data: The server reads the data sent by the client using read().

Send Response: After processing, the server sends a response back to the client using send().

Close the Socket: Finally, the server closes the connection using close().

Client Code:

Create a Socket: The client creates a TCP socket using socket().

Connect to Server: The client connects to the server using connect() and the server’s IP and port (5001).

Send Data: The client sends a message to the server using send().

Receive Response: The client waits for and reads the server's response using read().

Close the Socket: The client closes the socket after communication is finished with close().

How They Work Together:

The server listens on a specified port and waits for the client to connect.

The client connects to the server and sends data (e.g., text, images).

The server processes the data and sends a response back.

This basic TCP communication allows two programs to exchange information over a network.
